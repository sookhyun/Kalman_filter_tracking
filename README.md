# Kalman_filter_tracking
This repository contains updates to the initial implementation of the **Kalman Filter** and **Cellular Automaton** methods for the determination of *multiple collision event vertices* at the sPHENIX experiment. 

The sPHENIX charged particle tracking system consists of 3 layers of MVTX (Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor based VerTeX identification detector), 2 layers of INTT (INTermediate strip pixel silicon sensor Tracker) and 68 layers of TPC (gas-electron-multiplier based Time Projection Chamber). 

Initial implementation utilized triplets in the innermost MVTX to reconstruct all collision vertices present at a given crossing.
